📊 Big Data Analytics Mini Project
📌 Project Overview

This project is a Big Data Analytics Mini Project developed as part of academic coursework. The primary objective is to analyze datasets using PySpark and other big data tools, perform preprocessing, and generate meaningful insights through data visualization and analytics.

The project demonstrates skills in:

Handling large-scale data

Applying transformations and aggregations

Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Visualizing results effectively

⚙️ Technologies & Tools Used

Python 3 – Core programming language

Jupyter Notebook – For development and interactive analysis

PySpark – Distributed data processing

Pandas – Data handling and manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

NumPy – Numerical computations
